<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h4>

<p>Software architecture presents developers with a tool for organizing large,
complex software systems into various components, allowing the developers to
better understand the system as a whole by reducing the number of components
which must be kept in mind. It allows each developer to focus on a smaller
part of the system, and enables the development team to integrate its work
together by specifying the interfaces between the various parts in a clear and
well defined manner.</p>

<p>There are several different types of architectural views. The conceptual
architecture is a high-level view, with relatively few details, and is
particularly well suited for describing the functionality of a system.</p>

<p>In this paper, we investigate the conceptual architecture for the Firebird
database.</p>

<p>Firebird includes many tools and utilities for developing and administering a
database, and the code base includes code from older versions, as well as some
experimental branches (Firebird devel branch:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/code/HEAD/tree/firebird/trunk/">trunk</a> ).
We will not be considering these in our analysis.</p>

<p>We begin by discussing the overall architecture of the system. We then look at
the architectures of some of the subsystems, and we finally present scenarios
which illustrate the behaviour of the system in response to queries generated
by clients.</p>

<h4>
<a id="top-level-architecture" class="anchor" href="#top-level-architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Top-level architecture</h4>

<p>Firebird can be divided into four major components (see Figure 1): the remote
connection system, the SQL translator, the relational database engine, and the
lock manager. The arrows in the diagram indicate the flow of data. We include
the clients in the diagram to illustrate their relationship with the rest of
the system.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ibphoenix.com/images/doc_25_1.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: Top-level architecture</em></p>

<p><strong>remote connection system <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/code/HEAD/tree/firebird/branches/B2_5_Release/src/remote/">(REMOTE)</a>:</strong> This subsystem allows remote clients to connect to the database over different network protocols. It is composed of two parts: a client-side component and a server-side component. </p>

<p><strong>SQL translator <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/code/HEAD/tree/firebird/branches/B2_5_Release/src/dsql/">(DSQL)</a>:</strong> This subsystem translates requests from SQL into BLR, the native language of the database.</p>

<p><strong>relational database engine <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/code/HEAD/tree/firebird/branches/B2_5_Release/src/jrd/">(JRD)</a>:</strong> This subsystem performs the actual queries.</p>

<p><strong>lock manager <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/code/HEAD/tree/firebird/branches/B2_5_Release/src/lock/">(LOCK)</a>:</strong> This subsystem handles synchronization among transactions.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the remote connection system, SQL translator, and
relational database engine, can be seen as a pipe and filter style of
architecture: a request flows through the remote connection system, to the SQL
translator, where it is converted to BLR. The BLR goes through the relational
database, which returns a request through the remote connection system.</p>

<h4>
<a id="remote-communication" class="anchor" href="#remote-communication" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Remote communication</h4>

<p>The remote communication subsystem, REMOTE, allows clients to communicate
remotely, or locally, with the server. It enables communication over several
different network protocols, such as TCP/IP, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/f%0Airebird/code/HEAD/tree/firebird/branches/B2_5_Release/doc/README.xnet">XNET</a>
(replaced the former IPC/IPServer and is firebird implementation of the local
transport protocol) The subsystem is split roughly into two parts: a server
side, and a client side. It contains generic code for client-server
communication, as well as protocol-specific code.</p>

<p>It can be viewed as a layered system: conceptually, the client sends requests
to the server, through a generic communication layer. The generic layers
communicate through a protocol-specific layer, and the protocol-specific
layers communicate through the operating system's network stack. This is much
like to a two-layered version of the OSI reference network model.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ibphoenix.com/images/doc_25_2.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: Remote connection</em></p>

<p>The client can also communicate with the server locally, using a module which
emulates a network connection by using shared memory.</p>

<h4>
<a id="sql-translator" class="anchor" href="#sql-translator" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SQL translator</h4>

<p>The SQL translator,&gt;DSQL, converts SQL queries into the native BLR language.
Its architecture is like that of a simplified compiler: it contains a lexer,
parser, symbol table, and code generator.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ibphoenix.com/images/doc_25_3.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Figure 3: SQL translator</em></p>

<p>As in all compilers, the lexer, parser, and code generator are arranged,
conceptually, as a pipeline. The lexer divides the input into tokens, the
parser determines the meaning of the input, based on the tokens, and the code
generator emits BLR code which is equivalent to the original SQL.</p>

<h4>
<a id="jrd" class="anchor" href="#jrd" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JRD</h4>

<p>The JRD subsystem executes requests and returns their results. It handles the
access to the disk through a virtual IO system, verifies that security
constraints are followed, and ensures that transactions are handled
atomically.</p>

<p>Requests first pass through a compiler, which translates from BLR into an
internal representation of the request. It calls the metadata subsystem, MET,
to get metadata pertaining to the request, and to ensure that the requested
tables are present.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ibphoenix.com/images/doc_25_4.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Figure 4: Relational database engine</em></p>

<p>The Exec subsystem then processes the requests, using the B-tree subsystem for
indexing, the security subsystem to check user priviledges, the transation
subsystem to ensure atomic execution of a series of requests, the sort
subsystem to sort, and the lock manager to ensure concurrency. It uses a
virtual IO system to access the disk, and it uses the metadata subsystem to
operate on metadata.</p>

<p>The virtual IO subsystem is a layered system with three layers. The top layer
presents an abstract method for accessing the data on the disk. The second
layer, the cache manager, handes caching of the data, to speed up data access.
It is the last layer which has a concept of structured data in the database.
The final layer is a physical IO layer which is specific to the operating
system on which the engine is run, and makes the system calls to access the
disk.</p>

<h4>
<a id="jrd-and-lock-module" class="anchor" href="#jrd-and-lock-module" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JRD and Lock module</h4>

<p>The main purpose of the lock module is concurrency control, when multiple
users are accessing same database file simultaneously. Such situations are a
common occurrence during the normal operation of any DBMS.</p>

<p>Lock handling is separated into two major parts: the lock handler sub-module
inside the JRD and the Lock module that handles concurrent access to the lock
table. Figure 5 illustrates relationship between these parts.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ibphoenix.com/images/doc_25_5.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Figure 5: JRD and Lock module</em></p>

<p>Requests that need access to the lock mechanism are divided into two major
categories, metadata modification requests and usual data requests. Both of
these categories use lock the handler to be able to access the lock mechanism.</p>

<p>Normally when modification is needed, a lock on the appropriate data is
requested. Then modification is performed and the lock is released. If it is
impossible to gain a lock, the lock handler can wait certain amount of time
for the other lock handler to release the lock and then resume normal
execution.</p>

<p>The Lock module itself waits for the requests from lock handlers. From their
requests it performs modifications to the lock table.</p>

<h4>
<a id="use-scenarios" class="anchor" href="#use-scenarios" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use scenarios</h4>

<p>This section describes two common scenarios of the Firebird operation. These
help better understanding of the DBMS architecture.</p>

<h5>
<a id="scenario-1-new-table-creation" class="anchor" href="#scenario-1-new-table-creation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scenario 1: New table creation</h5>

<p>This scenario describes the creation of a new table in the database. When
reading through the following description, please refer to the appropriate
diagrams above.</p>

<ol>
<li>Request originates from the user application, and is passed to Remote module client side</li>
<li>Requests is packaged depending on the network used and passed through the network to the Remote server side</li>
<li>DSQL is called to transform request from SQL to BLR</li>
<li>JRD is called, CMP is called to compile the request</li>
<li>Exec is called to execute the request, MET is called</li>
<li>Request begins execution in MET since it modifies metadata for the DB</li>
<li>Lock handler is called to obtain a lock on the metadata of the DB</li>
<li>Lock handler calls Lock, which adds appropriate lock to the lock table</li>
<li>MET calls virtual IO library to commit changes to the disk</li>
<li>Appropriate disk handling routine is called depending on the file system</li>
<li>MET calls Lock handler, which calls Lock to remove lock from the Lock table</li>
<li>JRD calls Remote module to return success message to the user program</li>
<li>Remote moves the message through the network and get it to the user application</li>
</ol>

<h5>
<a id="scenario-2-search-for-a-row-by-index-field" class="anchor" href="#scenario-2-search-for-a-row-by-index-field" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scenario 2: Search for a row by index field</h5>

<p>This scenario describes simple search request to the database.</p>

<ol>
<li>Request is created in the user application and passed to the Remote client side</li>
<li>Remote moves request to the server side and calls DSQL</li>
<li>DSQL transform SQL of the request into BLR</li>
<li>JRD is called and CMP compiles the request</li>
<li>EXEC starts executing the request</li>
<li>Virtual IO is called to get appropriate table</li>
<li>Cache is checked for the data requested</li>
<li>Search routine in B-tree module is called to find row with appropriate index</li>
<li>Remote is called and returns result of the search to the user application</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<a id="extensibility-of-firebird" class="anchor" href="#extensibility-of-firebird" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extensibility of Firebird</h4>

<p>A good test for any system architecture is how it can accommodate future
changes and expansions. Firebird existed under different names since 1985;
obviously large number of changes and enhancements was implemented since then.
However the basic conceptual architecture did not change.</p>

<p>First, let's examine some changes made in the Remote module. With the
appearance of a large number of new LAN standards, Remote was modified to
allow it to work with them. Since all of the network communication routines
are isolated in the remote module, these changes do not affect other parts of
the system. An example of such a modification is the addition of the IPSERVER
module inside Remote. It was added to allow users to run Firebird on a single
Windows-based machine where client and server share one machine. This
modification was relatively simple, even though there is no LAN involved
whatsoever in this implementation.</p>

<p>A second example of modifications is the addition of the Windows file system
to the Virtual IO module. To add the ability to run Firebird on a machine
using the Windows file system, the only modification required was to add
another subsystem in the IO system that enables operation with the Windows
file system.</p>

<h4>
<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h4>

<p>In this paper, we discuss the conceptual architecture for Firebird. The system
is composed of four major compenents, arranged in a pipe and filter style. We
also look at the architecture within some of the subsystems. We provide
scenarios illustrating the behaviour of the system in response to different
client requests and the interactions between the subsystems, and we
demonstrate how the architecture allows for extensions to the system, such as
new network protocols or file systems.</p>
